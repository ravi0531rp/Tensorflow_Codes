# Tensorflow_Codes
* This repository includes all the Codes for different Courses and Specializations I did for Tensorflow.
* It involves simple ANNs, CNNs, RNNs to complex implementations of Customized Networks involving Object Detection & Segmentation, 
  Text Generators and many more cool projects.
